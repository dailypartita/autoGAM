Gridded Species Distribution: Global Amphibian Richness Grids, 2015 Release
Gridded Species Distribution: Global Mammal Richness Grids, 2015 Release


DESCRIPTION

The 2015 Release of the Global Amphibian and Mammal Richness Grids data sets are aggregations of the presence grids data for the entire class, individual families, and International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List status categories. The data are available in 30 arc-second (~1 km) resolutions. The grid cell values represent the number of species in a particular class, family, or IUCN threatened category. The input vector layers are based on the IUCN Red List and the grids are compiled by the Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN). The data from IUCN were downloaded in April 2013. 



ACCESSING THE DATA

The Global Amphibian Richness Grids may be downloaded via the World Wide Web at http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/species-global-amphibian-richness-2015.

The Global Mammal Richness Grids may be downloaded via the World Wide Web at http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/species-global-mammal-richness-2015.

The data are available as compressed zipfiles of GeoTIFF format. Downloaded files need to be uncompressed in a single folder using either WinZip (Windows file compression utility) or a similar application before they can be accessed by your GIS software package.


DATA FORMAT
This archive contains species richness grids in geographic projection at 30 arc-seconds (approximately 1 km).

File naming convention:

Family richness rasters are named as family.TIF

Amphibian Threat richness rasters are named as:
amphibians-all-threats representing richness of all IUCN Redlist amphibian threatened species
amphibians-critically-endangered representing richness of all IUCN Redlist amphibian critically endangered species 
amphibians-endangered representing richness of all IUCN Redlist amphibian endangered species
amphibians-vulnerable representing richness of all IUCN Redlist amphibian vulnerable species

Mammal Threat richness rasters are named as:
mammals-all-threats representing richness of all IUCN Redlist mammal threatened species
mammals-critically-endangered representing richness of all IUCN Redlist mammal critically endangered species 
mammals-endangered representing richness of all IUCN Redlist mammal endangered species
mammals-vulnerable representing richness of all IUCN Redlist mammal vulnerable species

Class rasters are named as:
all-amphibia representing all amphibian species in the class
all-mammalia representing all mammal species in the class
	
DATA VALUES	
Grid cell values represent the number of species present at each grid cell.
